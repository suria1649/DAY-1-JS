
Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2

HTTP as it stands for Hypertext Trasfer Protocol, which is the method 
through which information is requested and sent by computers. 
For Eg: when a user searches " http://www.google.co.in " 
the home page is requested by the computer as a protocol and is '
delivered back by the server.

which is used first since 1997 and its is still in use. Its upgraded 
version is HTTP2 which is introducd in  2015 is much faster in loading

objects and its internal representation in Javascript


Objects are data types in JS. 
They occur in Key and value pair. 
every object has its own properties.
These properties can be given using keys and assigning values to it.
They same way properties of the object can be accessed using key.
 

For Eg :  var suria = new Object();

suria.profession = "web developer"

suria.age = "24"

suria.education = "Engineer" 

considering suria as a object, properties of suria 
can be accessed through the syntax

suria.age 

output = 24
